### Hello, User! Welcome to the Contact Management System.

This system allows you to add the names, phone numbers, emails, and some additonal notes. It will print your contacts to the screen upon your request.

When you boot it up you will be taken to the main menu. You can add, edit, delete, or search contacts by phone number using the main menu, which will run when the program starts.

You can also export your file to a .txt document for easy perusal later.

The import featutre is not yet implemented. We hope to have it completed shortly so that your contact list can be exported, and then re-important to the program so that it can be edited and exported again later.

Following is a summary of requirements for this assignment:
